# MongoDB Query with Empty Array and $in Operator

This repository demonstrates a common issue when using the `$in` operator in MongoDB queries with an empty array.  The query returns no results, even if documents containing the field exist.

## Bug Description

A query like `db.collection.find({ field: { $in: [] } })` returns an empty array, regardless of whether the `field` exists in any documents.  This is counter-intuitive; one might expect the query to return *all* documents if the intention is to include any document regardless of the `field`'s value.

## Solution

The solution is to modify the query logic to handle the empty array case appropriately. One approach involves conditionally applying the `$in` operator only when the array is not empty.  Another involves using `$exists` operator to achieve the desired behavior.
